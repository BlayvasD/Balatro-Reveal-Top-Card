# QOL Mod: Reveal Top Card v2.1

[Reveal Top Card v2.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/balatro/mods/238) by [fct6488](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/fct6488) is a Balatro mod to implement an easier way to use the Collection Misprint technique to preview the top card of the draw pile. This version, v2.1, masks the card's enhancement, seal, and edition to eliminate the illicit gameplay advantage that v2.0 provided, making v2.1 a pure QOL mod like v1.0.
